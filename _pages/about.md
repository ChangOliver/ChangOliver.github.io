I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. I currently work in [Computer Security and Privacy Lab (CSPL)](https://cybersecurity.seas.wustl.edu/) supervised by Professor [Ning Zhang](https://cybersecurity.seas.wustl.edu/ning/index.html). My research interest lies at the intersection of cyber-physical security, medical security, and usable security & privacy for at-risk users.
