## Abstract
Smart home technologies offer convenience and security, but also raise privacy challenges shaped by cultural norms and household dynamics. We conducted an iterative Grounded Theory study using semi-structured interviews to examine how privacy is understood and managed in smart homes. Our initial data collection included participants from both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which highlighted a range of privacy tensions influenced by cultural expectations. Based on these insights, we focused subsequent data collection on Saudi households to explore how privacy concerns are navigated in specific religious and social contexts. Our findings show that privacy in Saudi homes is collectively negotiated and shaped by factors such as family hierarchies, interpersonal roles, and cultural obligations. Cameras, in particular, are perceived not merely as tools, but also as socially present entities, leading to behavioral adaptations and negotiated device usage. These insights underscore the importance of designing culturally responsive smart home technologies that align with local norms while supporting privacy and usability. By situating privacy within everyday household practice, this study contributes to broader discussions on culturally embedded design and privacy-aware innovation for smart homes.
