excerpt: 'Unlawful video surveillance of unsuspecting individuals using
spy cameras has become an increasing concern. To mitigate these
threats, there are both commercial products and research proto-
types designed to detect hidden spy cameras in household and
office environments. However, existing work often relies heavily
on user expertise and only applies to wireless cameras. To bridge
this gap, we propose HeatDeCam, a thermal-imagery-based spy
camera detector, capable of detecting hidden spy cameras with or
without built-in wireless connectivity. To reduce the reliance on
user expertise, HeatDeCam leverages a compact neural network
deployed on a smartphone to recognize unique heat dissipation
patterns of spy cameras. To evaluate the proposed system, we have
collected and open-sourced a dataset of a total of 22506 thermal and
visual images. These images consist of 11 spy cameras collected
from 6 rooms across different environmental conditions. Using this
dataset, we found HeatDeCam can achieve over 95% accuracy in
detecting hidden cameras. We have also conducted a usability eval-
uation involving a total of 416 participants using both an online
survey and an in-person usability test to validate HeatDeCam.'
